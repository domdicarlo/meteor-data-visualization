# 2018 Data Vis Meteor Visualization Project

In this class, one group project was to come up with our own data visualization of any dataset we could find. We primarily were to use D3 to accomplish this task. Because space is awesome, my group decided to visualize potential asteroid impacts and whether or not we should rationally fear them.

The resulting visualization is found in outcome.png. It originally was displayed on a poster, which explains why it might be hard to read on your monitor without some zooming in. 

I worked in an awesome group on this project, with Hasmik Grigoryan and Jose Arreluce. My task was to work out scaling the asteroids and working on color, and how to code these things, along with basic asteroid research. The difficult part is representing such a wide range of sizes of asteroids, which we ended up doing a cube root scale to accomplish. You can decide on how successful we were.

Explanatory information is found on the visualization. If you really want to dig into the details, you can look at the writeup.pdf. The code that accomplishes the vis is found in scaffold.
